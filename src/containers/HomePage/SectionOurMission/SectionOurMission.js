        Why weâ€™re working together
      </h4>
      <p>
        ANKC registered breeders breed for the continuity, health and excellent standards of purebred dogs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that breeders have years of experience and knowledge, as well as the unmatched passion for their breed to educate the wider community. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We are determined to better educate the wider community on the importance and beauty of purebred dogs around Australia and we want those that know the most - ANKC registered breeders to be at the forefront of that.
